**The Complexity:**
- EU AI Act: 148 articles, 1,000+ pages of guidance
- Industry-specific regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, etc.)
- Rapidly evolving regulatory landscape
- Technical complexity of AI explainability

**The Risk:**
- Regulatory penalties and fines
- Reputational damage and customer trust loss
- Operational disruption from compliance failures
- Competitive disadvantage from delayed implementations
